## 1. Executive Summary

You run a successful mall importing shoes and bags from China into Ghana. Business is strong in-store, and now you want to take it online — without losing control of what happens on the ground floor. This proposal is the blueprint for making that happen.

We will build you a **high-performance e-commerce website** paired with a **fully synchronized Point of Sale (POS) system**, so that every sale — whether it happens on your website at 2 AM or at the counter during Saturday rush hour — updates your stock in real time. No double-selling. No guesswork. One system, one truth.

**What you're getting:**

- A **professional online store** capable of listing up to **10,000 products** — every shoe style, every bag variant, every size and color
- A **dedicated POS system** for your in-store sales team that talks to the same database as the website — stock is always accurate, always in sync
- **Google Maps-powered delivery** — customers see their delivery fee calculated automatically based on how far they are from your mall
- A **full admin dashboard** where you control everything: products, categories, orders, customers, promotions, staff, analytics — all from one place
- A platform built to handle **heavy traffic** — flash sales, holiday rushes, viral social media moments — without breaking a sweat
- **Mobile-first design** — because your customers are shopping from their phones

This is not a template. This is not a generic shop. This is a system built around how *your* business actually works.

## 2. Understanding Your Business

### Who You Are

You operate a medium-sized mall in Ghana specializing in imported footwear and bags from China. Your product range includes men's, women's, and children's shoes across categories — sneakers, heels, sandals, boots, formal shoes, slippers — alongside handbags, backpacks, travel bags, wallets, clutches, and accessories. You deal in volume, you deal in variety, and your customers expect selection.

### What You Need

| Need | Why It Matters |
|------|---------------|
| **Online sales channel** | Reach customers beyond your physical location — across Accra and nationwide |
| **Massive product catalog** | You carry thousands of styles, each in multiple sizes and colors. The system must handle this without slowing down. |
| **Stock synchronization** | When a sales rep sells a pair of shoes in-store, the website must know immediately. When someone buys a bag online, the POS must reflect it. No exceptions. |
| **Delivery pricing by distance** | Fair delivery fees based on actual distance from your mall to the customer's location, calculated automatically |
| **Sales rep management** | Your team works the floor. They need a fast, simple POS — not a complicated admin panel. |
| **Complete business control** | You want to manage categories, pricing, promotions, and every aspect of your business yourself, without calling a developer |
| **Stress-proof performance** | When you post a promotion on social media and traffic spikes, the website must stay up and stay fast |

### Industry-Specific Challenges

Selling shoes and bags online has unique challenges that we've accounted for in this proposal:

- **Size complexity** — A single shoe model might come in 12+ sizes (EU 36–47) and 5 colors. That's 60 variants for one product. Multiply by thousands of styles, and you need a system that handles variant management elegantly.
- **Returns due to sizing** — Customers ordering shoes online frequently return due to sizing issues. The system needs smooth return and exchange workflows.
- **Visual-heavy shopping** — Shoes and bags are fashion items. Customers need to see them from multiple angles, in different colors, on models. The product gallery must be rich and fast-loading.
- **Seasonal stock** — Fashion moves fast. You need to quickly add new arrivals, mark items as trending, clear old stock with sales, and manage seasonal collections.
- **Size availability** — "Do you have this in a size 42?" is the most common question. The website must clearly show which sizes are available and which are sold out.

## 6. POS System & Real-Time Stock Synchronization

### 6.1 Why This Matters

You sell a pair of size 40 black sneakers in-store. At the exact same moment, a customer online adds the same shoe (last pair) to their cart and tries to check out. Without real-time synchronization, you've just double-sold a product you don't have.

**Our solution eliminates this entirely.** Both systems share the same database and use real-time subscriptions to stay in sync. Stock updates are instant and atomic — protected by database-level locking to prevent race conditions.

### 6.2 How Synchronization Works

```

**Key safeguards:**
- **Row-level locking** — Only one transaction can modify stock for a given variant at a time
- **Atomic transactions** — Stock check and reduction happen in a single database operation — no gap for double-selling
- **Real-time broadcasting** — Supabase Realtime pushes stock changes to all connected clients within 1-2 seconds
- **Optimistic UI with validation** — POS and website show immediate feedback but validate against the database before committing

## 7. Delivery & Google Maps Integration

### 7.1 How Delivery Pricing Works

We integrate three Google Maps APIs to create an intelligent, automated delivery pricing system:

1. **Google Places API** — Address autocomplete during checkout
2. **Google Geocoding API** — Convert addresses to GPS coordinates
3. **Google Distance Matrix API** — Calculate actual driving distance from your mall to the customer

```
CHECKOUT FLOW:

Customer enters address
        │
        ▼
Google Places Autocomplete
suggests full address
        │
        ▼
Address converted to
GPS coordinates (lat/lng)
        │
        ▼
Distance calculated from
mall to customer (driving km)
        │
        ▼
Delivery fee calculated
based on your pricing rules
        │
        ▼
Customer sees delivery fee
before paying
```

### 7.2 Delivery Zone Management (Admin)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Interactive Zone Editor** | Draw delivery zones on a Google Map. Use circles (radius from mall) or custom polygons (trace specific boundaries). |
| **Zone-Based Pricing** | Set a flat delivery fee per zone. Example: Zone 1 (0–5 km) = GHS 15, Zone 2 (5–15 km) = GHS 30, Zone 3 (15–30 km) = GHS 50. |
| **Distance-Based Pricing** | Instead of (or in addition to) zones, charge per kilometer. Example: GHS 5 base fee + GHS 2 per km. |
| **Hybrid Pricing** | Combine both: flat fee within a zone + per-km charge beyond a distance threshold. Maximum flexibility. |
| **Weight Surcharges** | Additional delivery charges for heavy orders (e.g., orders over 10 kg get a GHS 10 surcharge). |
| **Free Delivery Threshold** | "Free delivery on orders over GHS 500." Configurable minimum order value for free delivery. Can be set per zone. |
| **Free Delivery Zone** | Mark a zone where delivery is always free (e.g., immediate vicinity of the mall). |
| **No-Delivery Zones** | Define areas you don't deliver to. Customers in these areas see a clear message and are offered pickup instead. |
| **Delivery Time Estimates** | Set estimated delivery times per zone: Zone 1 = Same Day, Zone 2 = 1-2 Days, Zone 3 = 3-5 Days. |

### 7.3 Customer Delivery Experience

## 9. Performance & Scalability

### 9.1 The Challenge

10,000 products. Thousands of variants. Hundreds of concurrent visitors. Flash sale traffic spikes. Multiple POS terminals. All hitting the same system at the same time. It must be fast. It must stay up.

### 9.2 How We Handle It

#### Database Performance

| Strategy | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Strategic Indexing** | Database indexes on every frequently searched column — product name, SKU, category, price, size, color, status. Queries that would scan 10,000 rows instead hit an index and return in milliseconds. |
| **Full-Text Search Index** | PostgreSQL GIN index for product search. Searching "black leather sneaker 42" across 10,000 products returns results in under 500ms. |
| **Connection Pooling** | Supabase PgBouncer pools database connections. Hundreds of simultaneous users share a managed pool of connections without overwhelming the database. |
| **Cursor-Based Pagination** | Product listings use cursor-based pagination instead of OFFSET. Performance stays constant whether you're on page 1 or page 100. |
| **Materialized Views** | Pre-computed views for complex aggregations (category counts, product rankings, analytics). These are refreshed periodically, not computed on every request. |

#### Application Performance

| Strategy | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** | Dynamic pages (cart, checkout, account) are rendered on the server for fast initial load and SEO. |
| **Static Site Generation (SSG)** | Product pages, category pages, and blog posts are pre-rendered as static HTML. Served directly from the CDN — near-instant load times. |
| **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** | When a product is updated, only that page is regenerated — not the entire site. Changes appear within seconds without rebuilding 10,000 pages. |
| **Edge Caching (CDN)** | Static assets, images, and pages are cached on Vercel's global CDN. Users in Accra, Kumasi, Tamale — all served from the nearest edge node. |
| **Image Optimization** | All product images automatically converted to WebP, resized for the display context, and lazy-loaded. A page with 50 product thumbnails loads fast because only visible images are fetched. |
| **Code Splitting** | Only the JavaScript needed for the current page is loaded. The checkout page doesn't load blog page code, and vice versa. |

#### Traffic Resilience

| Strategy | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Serverless Auto-Scaling** | Hosted on Vercel's serverless infrastructure. When traffic spikes, more server instances spin up automatically. No manual scaling needed. |
| **Rate Limiting** | API endpoints are rate-limited to prevent abuse. Protects against bot attacks and ensures fair usage during peak traffic. |
| **Background Processing** | Heavy operations (bulk imports, report generation, email campaigns) run in the background without affecting the shopping experience. |
| **Graceful Degradation** | If a non-essential service hiccups (analytics, recommendations), the core shopping experience continues unaffected. |

### 9.3 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Homepage Load Time | < 1.5 seconds |
| Product Page Load Time | < 2 seconds |
| Product Search (10,000 products) | < 500ms |
| POS Transaction (scan to receipt) | < 3 seconds |
| Stock Sync (POS ↔ Website) | < 2 seconds |
| Checkout Page Load | < 2 seconds |
| Concurrent Users Supported | 1,000+ |
| Product Image Load | < 1 second (lazy-loaded) |
| Uptime | 99.9% |

## 10. Security

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|-----------|
| **Authentication** | Secure login with email/password and phone OTP. Bcrypt password hashing. Session management with automatic timeout. |
| **Authorization** | Row-Level Security (RLS) at the database level. Every query is filtered by the user's role and permissions. A sales rep literally cannot query admin data even if they tried. |
| **Data Encryption** | All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). |
| **Payment Security** | No payment data stored on our servers. All payment processing handled by PCI-compliant gateways (Moolre). |
| **Bot Protection** | Google reCAPTCHA v3 on registration, login, and checkout forms. |
| **Input Validation** | All user inputs validated and sanitized on both client and server to prevent injection attacks. |
| **XSS / CSRF Protection** | Content Security Policy headers, SameSite cookies, and React's built-in XSS protection. |
| **Rate Limiting** | API rate limits on sensitive endpoints (login, payment, search) to prevent brute force and abuse. |
| **Audit Logging** | Every admin and POS action logged with timestamp, user, IP, and details. Full accountability. |
| **Data Backup** | Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery. Your data is never at risk. |
| **Dependency Security** | Regular security audits of all third-party packages. Automated vulnerability alerts. |
| **Access Control** | Role-based permissions ensure staff only see what they need. Sensitive data (financials, customer PII) is restricted. |
